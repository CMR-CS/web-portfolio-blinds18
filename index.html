            <p>In this unit, I learned a lot of the basics of web page design. I learned about tags, and how to do a lot of things to make a web page. I learned how to do basic hyperlinks, which turned out to be pretty easy to understand. We also did some text formatting, like bold and italics. We did formatting, like date and time. Also we did lists, both ordered and unordered. We also learned about some of the history of the Internet as in where it came from.</p>
